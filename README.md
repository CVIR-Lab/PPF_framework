Potential Pursuit Field (PPF), a novel reward shaping framework aimed to address the reward sparsity in reinforcement learning for dynamic target pursuit. By designing a droplet-shaped anisotropic potential field, the proposed PPF model provides dense and direction-aware reward signals while preserving policy invariance through potential-based reward shaping. Building upon PPF, we developed a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling target pursuit and obstacle avoidance in non-line-of-sight(NLOS) environments, simultaneously.

### A novel concept of the Potential Pursuit Field (PPF) is proposed to support a continuous and dense reward-shaping function, which can capture anisotropic features and obtain richer gradient information than that of traditional rewards.
